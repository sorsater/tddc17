MyAgentStateclass has the following fields added to them:

 StateWorld, a 30x30 array that cointains our own class Node (each node has a parent, position, and distance)
 qNodes, a linked list used for storing nodes during breadth first search.
 bool mapDone, true if we are fully done.

If there is dirt, remove it. Else
Go towards the goal if there is one defined by following the currentNodes parent (as specified by the bfs). Else
Use breadth first search for finding the closest availible unexplored tile, abort search when one is found.





Our BFS is
